Basically the logic is 
to set time once the message is typed by clicking the enter button. And if we see that message is needs to be unsend, we need to cancel the message.



We need state handling using 5 usestates ---
1. to store the message(usestate variable) we type in textarea
2.once enter button, message needs to drop under another state which is for display and textarea becomes empty
3. Adding the sendhandle function while clicking enter, to delay for the message to be sent into textarea. By using settimeout. The button will be changed into "Cancel Message"
4. Then if we want to cancel, we will add handlecancel function on this changed button "Cancel Message" to clear the timeout. 
5. In between this , we need to detect whether the message is sendingmode or not - so we use another Boolean usestate to set this value based on the condition
